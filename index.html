        <h3>Note from Neeharika</h3>
        <p>Thank you for supporting my musical journey.</p>
        <p>
          The past four and a half years as a music major at two different
          universities have given me so many challenges, opportunities and
          experiences to reflect on. Seventeen year old Neeharika walking into
          her first college audition never expected the journey that was ahead
          of her. But I am so grateful that it brought her to me.
        </p>
        <p>
          The music I am presenting this evening has two meanings: Reflecting
          upon aspects of my musical identity and the journey that brought me
          here, while simultaneously serving as a reminder of what is yet to be
          discovered. This is what Soul-Quest, the title of my recital, means to
          me. Thank you for letting me share a piece of myself with you, and if
          you resonate with any of the pieces today, hearing about it would
          bring me so much joy. Enjoy the performance!

        <h2>Court Dances by Amanda Harberg</h2>
        <h3>Context</h3>
        <p>
          In Court Dances, Amanda Harberg’s palette sparkles with her trademark
          sense of magic, delight and warmth. Initially inspired by the fast and
          syncopated bounce of a squash ball, Court Dances grew into a
          celebratory and soulful suite in three virtuosic movements.
        </p>
        <p>
          The lyrical and flowing second movement, Air de Cour, offers an
          introspective contrast to the more gregarious first and final
          movements. The dynamic final movement, Tambourin, opens with running
          16ths exchanged between the flute and piano. Accents, syncopation, and
          sparkling runs, as well as percussive effects and flutter tonguing,
          further develop the excitement alluded to in the opening.
        </p>
        <p>(Information from Amanda Harberg’s website)</p>
        <h3>What it means to me:</h3>
        <p>
          Court Dances is one of those pieces where listening to it or playing
          it over and over again never gets old. There is always something new
          to discover within this piece. Today, I chose to play only the second
          and third movements, because I resonate so strongly with both of them.
          To me, the second movement represents serenity in a world of chaos,
          and the third movement represents uniqueness and unapologetically
          taking up the space to be myself. Ultimately, it’s such a fun piece,
          and I’m so excited to share it!
        </p>
        <h2>O Mio Babbino Caro by Giacomo Puccini</h2>
        <h3>Context</h3>
        <p>
          Gianni Schicchi (from which this piece originates) is one part of a
          trio of one-act operas entitled Il Trittico (The Triptych). Puccini
          had initially planned for each section to represent one of the parts
          of Dante’s Divine Comedy, however in the end, only Gianni Schicchi
          represented the epic poem.
        </p>
        <p>
          A very brief synopsis of the opera (which is based in 13th century
          Florence on an incident recalled in Divine Comedy) sees Dante visit
          the Circle of Impersonators where he sees one man attacking another
          man. Dante finds out that the attacker is Gianni Schicchi who has been
          condemned to Hell for impersonating Buoso Donati. The opera is based
          around how the seemingly ingenious peasant (Schicchi) is able to cash
          in on Donati’s will whilst also securing a pay-off for his daughter’s
          wedding.
        </p>
        <p>
          O mio babbino caro (‘Oh My Beloved Father’) is a soprano aria that
          comes in the middle of the opera where Schicchi’s daughter, Lauretta
          sings after tensions rise between her father and the family of
          Rinuccio, the family of the boy that she loves. The aria provides a
          breath of fresh air after the atmosphere has become tense with
          jealousy and anger between different characters. It is the only ‘set
          piece’ of the opera, as the rest is through-composed.
        </p>
        <h3>The lyrics are as follows:</h3>
        <p>
          O mio babbino caro – Oh my beloved father <br />mi piace, è bello,
          bello. – I love him, I love him! <br />Vo’andare in Porta Rossa – I’ll
          go to Porta <br />
          Rossa a comperar l’anello! – To buy our wedding ring
        </p>
        <p>
          O mio babbino caro – Oh my beloved father <br />
          mi piace, è bello, bello. – I love him, I love him! <br />
          Vo’andare in Porta Rossa – I’ll go to Porta Rossa <br />
          a comperar l’anello! – To buy our wedding ring
        </p>
        <p>
          Mi struggo e mi tormento – My love for which I suffer <br />
          O Dio, vorrei morir! – Dear God, I would want to die! <br />
          Babbo, pietà, pietà! – Father I beg, I beg <br />
          Babbo, pietà, pietà! – Father I beg, I beg.
        </p>
        <p>**</p>
        <p>
          The short, but very powerful formal aria is written in Ab major and is
          in 6/8 time. The song is slow, simple and exquisite in every way, and
          that is why, in context of the opera, it is a big statement from
          Lauretta. Now one of Puccini’s most popular arias, it is sung on its
          own as part of encores and concerts.
        </p>
        <p>
          Puccini’s word-painting is subtle yet very effective throughout the
          whole aria, with emphasis on the line “I love him, I love him!”, where
          the soprano jumps an octave from Ab to a top Ab, creating a sense of
          drama and emotion. The end of the aria shows a small change in rhythm,
          where Lauretta begs her father to let her marry her love.

        <h3>What it means to me</h3>
        <p>
          O Mio Babbino Caro is absolutely one of my favorite pieces for Soprano
          Voice. This piece was introduced to me by my voice instructor in
          Massachusetts, and I have held it with me since that moment. Over the
          past few years, studying this piece both by myself and with various
          instructors has helped me improve my ability to truly immerse myself
          in the character of the music I am performing. In addition, the beauty
          of the piece paired with the drama of the character makes it one of my
          favorite pieces to perform with some Leo Diva energy!

        <h2>A Room of Quiet by Nathan Hall</h2>
        <h3>Context:</h3>
        <p>
          In the words of the composer:
          <br />
          “In sketching out this work, I went through a few texts about peace. A
          friend suggested Dag Hammarskjöld, who helped found the United
          Nations, and who was born in Sweden, where I happened to be going for
          a residency to write this commission. Dag wrote much more poetic
          works, but I liked how simple this text was and how even its
          description evoked self-reflection. Dag talks about the two main
          elements in the U.N. Meditation Room being a beam of light and a block
          of iron. I had the realization that this would be the perfect analogy
          for this ensemble: the flute can evoke the shaft of light, and the
          black mass of a grand piano is the block of iron ore in the middle of
          the room. And thus, the concert hall, or wherever this work is played,
          can also become a meditation room: a space that is open to thought and
          prayer, and hopes for peace.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Dag Hammarskjöld’s Text:
          <br />
          "We all have within us a center of stillness surrounded by silence.
          This house, dedicated to work and debate in the service of peace,
          should have one room dedicated to silence in the outward sense and
          stillness in the inner sense. It has been the aim to create in this
          small room a place where the doors may be open to the infinite lands
          of thought and prayer. People of many faiths will meet here, and for
          that reason none of the symbols to which we are accustomed in our
          meditation could be used. However, there are simple things which speak
          to us all with the same language. We have sought for such things and
          we believe that we have found them in the shaft of light striking the
          shimmering surface of solid rock.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, in the middle of the room we see a symbol of how, daily, the light
          of the skies gives life to the earth on which we stand, a symbol to
          many of us of how the light of the spirit gives life to matter. But
          the stone in the middle of the room has more to tell us. We may see it
          as an altar, [...] dedicated to the God whom man worships under many
          names and in many forms. The stone in the middle of the room reminds
          us also of the firm and permanent in a world of movement and change.
          The block of iron ore has the weight and solidity of the
          everlasting.... The material of the stone leads our thoughts to the
          necessity for choice between destruction and construction, between war
          and peace. Of iron man has forged his swords, of iron he has also made
          his ploughshares.
        </p>
        <p>
          Of iron he has constructed tanks, but of iron he has likewise built
          homes for man. The block of iron ore is part of the wealth we have
          inherited on this earth of ours. How are we to use it? The shaft of
          light strikes the stone in a room of utter simplicity. There are no
          other symbols, there is nothing to distract our attention or to break
          in on the stillness within ourselves... There is an ancient saying
          that the sense of a vessel is not in its shell but in the void. So it
          is with this room. It is for those who come to fill the void with what
          they find in their center of stillness”.

        <h3>What it means to me:</h3>
        <p>
          The first time I heard “A Room of Quiet” was my freshman year of
          college at UMass Amherst. A masters student was performing it for
          studio class, and I was immediately intrigued. The poetic words, the
          three different types of flutes paired with speaking, singing and
          playing into an open piano, the collaboration between the pianist and
          the flutist, all pulled me in and I knew immediately that one day I
          would be performing this piece. Four years later, here I am! To me,
          this piece represents the potential we all have within us to use our
          talents and resources for good versus evil, and how the choice is up
          to us. I interpret it to reprepresent this concept within ourselves as
          individuals, and on a greater scale as a society. The meditative
          nature of the piece allows for each individual to reflect on what it
          means to them personally, and that is one of my favorite artistic
          aspects of this piece.

          Fantaisie Pastorale Hongroise (Hungarian Pastoral Fantasy) <br />
          by Franz Doppler
        </h2>
        <h3>Context:</h3>
        <p>
          Franz Doppler was a flutist, composer, and conductor, who made his
          debut in Vienna at the age of thirteen. His first teacher was his
          father, the composer and oboist Joseph Doppler. From a young age,
          Franz made successful concert tours with his brother, Karl (a flutist,
          composer, and conductor). The Doppler brothers' tours included a visit
          to the Weimar court (1854), where they met the great Hungarian pianist
          Liszt, as well as a tour to London (1856) with the violinist Karl
          Hubay. As an orchestral musician, Doppler held posts as early as 1838
          as principal flutist of the German Town Theater, and then at the
          Hungarian National Theater in 1841. Later in his life (1864-67),
          Doppler became a professor of flute at the Vienna Conservatory.
          Doppler’s compositions reflect Hungarian, Russian, and Polish folk
          music in addition to Italian opera influences. Many of these
          influences can be heard in Fantaisie pastorale hongroise, op. 26, with
          its hauntingly nostalgic opening fantasy reminiscent of Romani and
          Eastern European folk music and its folk tune/dance-driven second
          half.

        <h3>What it means to me:</h3>
        <p>
          As it is one of the most popular flute pieces of the Romantic era, it
          is not surprising that this piece is one of my favorites of all time.
          Anyone who knows my musical tastes knows that I am a huge fan of
          Romantic era music, and this piece just encapsulates so many aspects
          of my favorite parts of being a flutist and what comes with playing
          Romantic flute music. The opening truly is hauntingly beautiful, and
          the virtuosic passages throughout the piece, especially in the second
          half, makes it such a challenging yet rewarding piece to play. As a
          fun fact, this is the piece I was self-studying while I was looking
          for a professional flute back in 2020, and this piece helped me find
          my beloved Haynes flute, Roja (yes, I name my instruments!). It only
          made sense for me to study this piece this semester to perform as an
          homage to Roja, who has gotten me through the better half of my
          undergrad degree.

          Professor Kinshuk Srivastava, Neeharika’s Guru, teaches Hindustani
          vocal music to master’s students at Banasthali Vidyapith, which is a
          University in Radhakishanpura, Rajasthan, India. Bhor Hi Aaye Jogi is
          an original composition by Professor Srivastava set in the raag Nat
          Bhairav.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nat Bhairav is a Hindustani classical heptatonic raag of the Bhairav
          Thaat (category). Traditionally it is a morning raga. This raga is a
          combination of raag Nat in Poorvang (the lower half of the scale) and
          raag Bhairav in Uttarang (the upper half of the scale). In this raag,
          Re (shortened for Rishab, which is the second scale degree) is Shudh
          (natural) while Dha (shortened for Dhaivat, which is the sixth scale
          degree) is Komal (flat). This raag has been made popular by Pandit
          Ravi Shankar, who is a world famous Sitar player.
        </p>
        <p>
          “The beauty of nature is vast; so is the melody of Nat Bhairav, which
          suggests bliss where one can indulge in the search of the true sense
          of life.”

            like oil from one vessel to another. In other words, the practice of
            Yoga is to harness complete focus, which can be through Asanas, but
            also through virtually any activity. (This tid-bit is just a small

          Shiva’s voice. Many songs sung in Bhairav are devotional pieces in
          admiration of Lord Shiva.

          aspects of this raag is the fact that the natural second degree mixed
          with the flat sixth degree adds a sense of longing to the raag, as I
          interpret it. This raag, along with others in the Bhairav Thaat feels
          to me like morning meditation and devotion to Lord Shiva. Shiva’s
          image, with his signature crescent moon on his forehead, is at the
          center of my recital poster. What he stands for is one of the biggest
          inspirations to me as an artist, as Shiva is known to be extremely
          talented and wise in the world of fine arts and meditation.
