        <h3>Note from Neeharika</h3>
        <p>Thank you for supporting my musical journey.</p>
        <p>
          The past four and a half years as a music major at two different
          universities have given me so many challenges, opportunities and
          experiences to reflect on. Seventeen year old Neeharika walking into
          her first college audition never expected the journey that was ahead
          of her. But I am so grateful that it brought her to me.
        </p>
        <p>
          The music I am presenting this evening has two meanings: Reflecting
          upon aspects of my musical identity and the journey that brought me
          here, while simultaneously serving as a reminder of what is yet to be
          discovered. This is what Soul-Quest, the title of my recital, means to
          me. Thank you for letting me share a piece of myself with you, and if
          you resonate with any of the pieces today, hearing about it would
          bring me so much joy. Enjoy the performance!

        <h2>Court Dances by Amanda Harberg</h2>
        <h3>Context</h3>
        <p>
          In Court Dances, Amanda Harberg’s palette sparkles with her trademark
          sense of magic, delight and warmth. Initially inspired by the fast and
          syncopated bounce of a squash ball, Court Dances grew into a
          celebratory and soulful suite in three virtuosic movements.
        </p>
        <p>
          The lyrical and flowing second movement, Air de Cour, offers an
          introspective contrast to the more gregarious first and final
          movements. The dynamic final movement, Tambourin, opens with running
          16ths exchanged between the flute and piano. Accents, syncopation, and
          sparkling runs, as well as percussive effects and flutter tonguing,
          further develop the excitement alluded to in the opening.
        </p>

        <h3>What it means to me:</h3>
        <p>
          Court Dances is one of those pieces where listening to it or playing
          it over and over again never gets old. There is always something new
          to discover within this piece. Today, I chose to play only the second
          and third movements, because I resonate so strongly with both of them.
          To me, the second movement represents serenity in a world of chaos,
          and the third movement represents uniqueness and unapologetically
          taking up the space to be myself. Ultimately, it’s such a fun piece,
          and I’m so excited to share it!
